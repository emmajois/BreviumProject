Thank you for reviewing my project! 

It's not an overly large repo so I'm sure you can find your way around but regardless, the majority of my code is just living in the Program.cs file. I also have a few classes all in the AppointmentInfo.cs file. 

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
